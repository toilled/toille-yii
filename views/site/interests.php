        <h2 class="title">My Interests</h2>
    </header>
    <p>In addition to my professional commitments, I engage in developing new coding ideas as a hobby during my spare
        time. This pursuit not only allows me to explore innovative concepts but also enables me to stay informed about
        emerging programming languages and technologies.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, I maintain an active interest in music. I play several musical instruments, with the guitar being my
        primary focus. My passion for music has led me to create original compositions, some of which I have shared on
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@toilled" class="contrast" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. This platform serves as
        a means for me to express my creativity and connect with others who share similar interests.</p>
    <p class="marginless">Through these hobbies, I continue to enhance my skills and broaden my horizons in both
        technology and the arts.</p>
