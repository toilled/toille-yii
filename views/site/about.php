    </header>
    <p>I am a BSc (Hons) graduate who has been confident working with computers in some way for most of my life.</p>
    <p>With 14 years of experience in software and web development, I have primarily focused on PHP, while also
        utilizing JavaScript on various occasions. My expertise encompasses a comprehensive understanding of version
        control systems, particularly Git, and proficiency in managing MySQL databases.</p>
    <p>Throughout my career, I have gained experience with multiple frameworks and libraries, notably:
    <ul>
        <li>Laravel and Symfony for PHP, which enhances the development of robust applications.</li>
        <li>React and SolidJS for JavaScript, allowing for the creation of dynamic user interfaces.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="marginless">This diverse skill set positions me well for contributing to complex projects in the software
        development landscape.</p>
